# Financial Analysis Using DAX Query
This project focuses on analysing financial data for a banking institution to evaluate credit card usage, customer behaviour, and financial performance. Using DAX functions in Power BI, various metrics such as running totals, moving averages, growth rates, and customer churn are calculated. The analysis aims to provide valuable insights for enhancing customer retention, managing credit risk, and improving financial performance.

## Data Analysis Steps:
1. Running Totals & Moving Averages:
Calculated running totals for transactions and 4-week moving averages for credit limits.
2. Growth Calculations:
Measured month-over-month (MoM) and week-over-week (WoW) growth in transaction amounts.
3. Customer Metrics & KPIs:
Determined Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) as a ratio of transaction amount.
Created KPIs for customer churn and high-risk clients.
4. Risk Assessment & Scoring:
Calculated credit risk scores based on utilization ratio, delinquent accounts, and revolving balance.
Measured delinquency rates and identified high-risk clients.
5. Correlation & Satisfaction Analysis:
Analyzed income vs. credit limit correlation and calculated average customer satisfaction by credit card category.
6. Loan Analysis:
Compared average credit limits for clients with and without personal loans.

## Tools & Techniques:
* Tools Used: Power BI (DAX Functions)
* Techniques: Data Aggregation, KPI Creation, Growth Analysis, Risk Scoring, Correlation Analysis.
  
## Outcome:
